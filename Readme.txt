This is a demonstration of the blind light field image quality assessment method described in:

Jianjun Xiang, Gangyi Jiang, Mei Yu,  Yongqiang Bai and Zhongjie Zhu. "No-reference light field image quality 
assessment based on depth, structural and angular information", Signal Processing, 2021, 184(4):108063.

You can change this program as you like and use it anywhere, but please
refer to its original source (cite our paper).

=======================================================================
An exmaple ( Matlab codes and light field image) are provided to demonstrate how to use the package. 

1) Run extract_features.m and you can get perceputal features.
